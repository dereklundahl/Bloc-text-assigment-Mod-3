#### Questions

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

A: Pseudocode is used to organize an algorithm, program, or application into the proper steps so that the regular code can be written by simply translating the pseudocode into the proper syntax. It allows programmers to develop the algorithms for the code with total focus on the steps and the process.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

A: It would not compile because it does not follow any language syntax.

#### Programming Assignment

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

```
FUNCTION compareNumbers
  GET first number
  GET second number
  IF first number is bigger than second number
    PRINT first number
  ELSE
    PRINT second number
  END IF
END FUNCTION
```

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

```
FUNCTION printOneToOnehundred
  INIT number to 1
  WHILE number is less than or equal to 100
    Increment number
    PRINT number
  END WHILE
END FUNCTION
```

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

```
FUNCTION phonebookSearch
  GET name to search for
  IF name is found
    PRINT all of the information for the object
  ELSE name is not found
    PRINT "This name is not found. Please check the spelling and try again."
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION
  
```

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

```
const phoneBook = [
 
  {
  lastName: "Kreuger", 
  firstName: "Fred", 
  phoneNumber: "555-555-5555" 
  },
  
  {
  lastName: "Meyers", 
  firstName: "Mikey", 
  phoneNumber: "666-666-6666"
  },
  
  {
  lastName: "Lundahl", 
  firstName: "Derek", 
  phoneNumber: "777-777-7777"
  },

];



const phonebookSearch = (name) => {
  
  let text = "";
  
  let search = name.toLowerCase();
  
  for (let i = 0; i < phoneBook.length; i++) {
    
    if (search == phoneBook[i].lastName.toLowerCase()) {
            
      text += `Last Name: ${phoneBook[i].lastName} First Name: ${phoneBook[i].firstName} Phone: ${phoneBook[i].phoneNumber}`
     } else {
        
        text = ""
    
    }

  
  }
  return text === "" ? `Sorry. ${search} is not found. Check spelling and try again.` : text;

}





console.log(phonebookSearch('LUNDAHL'));
```
